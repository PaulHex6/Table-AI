## Excel File Structure

### **Input Structure**:

The Excel file you upload should be structured as follows:

- **Row 1**: Contains headers (optional for your understanding, not used in processing).
- **Row 2**: Contains the prompts where `{parameter}` is a placeholder for the dynamic content.
- **Column A (starting from Row 3)**: Contains the parameters that will replace the `{parameter}` placeholder in the prompts.
- **Column B and beyond (starting from Row 2)**: Contains the different prompt templates.

#### Example:

|    A          |       B                                      |       C                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Parameter 1   | Prompt 1                                      | Prompt 2                                  |
| Review 1      | What is the sentiment of this review: {parameter}? | Generate a reply to this review: {parameter} |
| Review 2      | What is the sentiment of this review: {parameter}? | Generate a reply to this review: {parameter} |

### **Output Structure**:

After processing, the Excel file will be updated with the responses from GPT models in the cells corresponding to each parameter and prompt combination.

#### Example Output:

|    A          |       B                                      |       C                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Parameter 1   | Prompt 1                                      | Prompt 2                                  |
| Review 1      | Positive sentiment                            | Thank you for your feedback! We're glad you enjoyed your experience. |
| Review 2      | Negative sentiment                            | We're sorry to hear that you had a bad experience. We'll work on improving our service. |

### **Explanation**:

- **Row 2**: Defines the prompts with `{parameter}` as a placeholder.
- **Column A**: Contains the parameters (e.g., `Review 1`, `Review 2`).
- **Columns B and beyond**: Contain the responses generated by the selected GPT model, where the `{parameter}` placeholder in the prompts is replaced by the actual parameters from Column A.

## When to use it?

- **Dynamic Prompting**: By structuring your file in this way, you can create highly dynamic and personalized content for each parameter.
- **Scalability**: This structure allows you to easily scale the content generation by adding more parameters (rows) or prompts (columns).
- **Efficiency**: The app automates the replacement of parameters in prompts and generates responses, saving time and ensuring consistency.
